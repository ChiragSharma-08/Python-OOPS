# Polymorphism = Greek word that means to "have many forms of faces"
#                Poly = Many
#                Morphe = Form

#                TWO WAYS TO ACHIEVE POLYMORPHISM
#                1.Inheritance = An object could be treated of the same type as a parent class
#                2.Duck Typing = Object must have necessary attributes/methods
